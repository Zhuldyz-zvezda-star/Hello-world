# About
# Anthropology is concerned with how humans and human societies evolve, with the differences and similarities among human cultures, and with the cultural and biological basis for human behavior. 
# Anthropology integrates a wide range of perspectives on human behavior, culture, and society. 
# Anthropology covers a wide range of geographical and topical specialties in all four subfields of anthropology.
# Social and cultural anthropology, archaeology, physical anthropology (biological or medical anthropology), and anthropological linguistics. 
# All four are embedded in a context of anthropological training of broad theoretical and geographical scope.
 # Archaeology
# The Archaeology program emphasizes comparative study of the emergence and development of complex societies, from their initial foundations in hunter-gatherer behavior to their manifestation as states and empires. 
# This theoretical approach is firmly grounded in the use of empirical archaeological data from around the world to evaluate models that offer understanding of the dynamics of change in human societies. 
# Biological Anthropology
# Biological Anthropology which provides students with the background to study: 
# morphology, 
# systematics, 
# bio-archaeology, 
# paleopathology, 
# anatomy,
# evolution. 
# Cultural anthropologists collaborate with cognitive and medical scientists, linguists, historians, 
# sociologists, political scientists, and scholars in urban, legal, and Gender, Sexuality and Women's Studies.
# Linguistic anthropology examines the relationship between language and other aspects of culture and society.  
# Courses offered regularly include language and culture, writing and recording, ritual, digital media, and language ideologies.
